# My Java Learning Journey

## Day-1  
**Date:** 19-Jan-2025  
**Topics:**  
- Basic Arithmetic & Mathematical Computations (Addition, Average, Power Calculation).  
- Geometry & Measurements (Area of Circle, Perimeter of Rectangle, Volume of Cylinder).  
- Conversions & Finance (Temperature Conversion, Distance Conversion, Simple Interest Calculation).  

## Day-2  
**Date:** 22-Jan-2025  
**Topics:**  
- Java Fundamentals & Data Handling â€“ Understanding Java comments, basic data types, and variables to store and manipulate data efficiently.  
- Operators & Expressions â€“ Practicing arithmetic operations, operator precedence, and type conversion to ensure accurate computations.  
- User Interaction & Input Handling â€“ Implementing user input functionality to build interactive programs.  

## Day-3  
**Date:** 23-Jan-2025  
**Topics:**  
- Control Flow & Decision Making â€“ Understanding Java control flows, boolean data types, boolean expressions, logical operators, and conditional statements (if, else if, else).  
- Looping & Program Execution Control â€“ Implementing loops (for, while), using break and continue statements to control flow, and handling multiple conditions using the switch statement.  

## Day-4  
**Date:** 25-Jan-2025  
**Topics:**  
- Array Operations & Manipulation â€“ Creating, accessing, modifying arrays, and iterating through them using loops while utilizing the length property for dynamic operations.  
- Multi-Dimensional Arrays & Matrix Handling â€“ Working with multi-dimensional arrays, accessing elements, finding sizes, and performing matrix-related computations.  
- System Handling & Error Management â€“ Using Java's System.err for error messages and System.exit() to control program termination.  

## Day-5  
**Date:** 28-Jan-2025  
**Topics:**  
- Method Creation & Reusability â€“ Defining user-defined methods, reusing them multiple times, and making them dynamic by passing parameters.  
- Advanced Method Handling â€“ Implementing recursive methods for repetitive tasks, utilizing static methods, and leveraging Javaâ€™s standard library methods.  
- Mathematical Computations â€“ Using the java.lang.Math class for mathematical operations like exponentiation, rounding, and trigonometric calculations.  

## Day-6  
**Date:** 29-Jan-2025/1  
**Topics:**  
- String Handling & Operations â€“ Working with strings using common string functions like concatenation, substring extraction, length calculation, and case conversion.  
- Function Implementation & Parameter Passing â€“ Creating functions, passing parameters, and returning values to make methods more reusable and dynamic.  

## Day-7  
**Date:** 29-Jan-2025/2  
**Topics:**  
- String Handling & Operations â€“ Working with strings using common string functions like concatenation, substring extraction, length calculation, and case conversion.  
- Function Implementation & Parameter Passing â€“ Creating functions, passing parameters, and returning values to make methods more reusable and dynamic.  

## Day-8  
**Date:** 31-Jan-2025  
**Topics:**  
- Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Procedural programming focuses on functions and procedures to perform tasks, while OOP organizes code around objects and classes, encouraging reusability, inheritance, and encapsulation.  
- Class and Object: A class defines the blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of that class, used to represent real-world entities with properties and methods, encapsulating behavior and data.  

## Day-9  
**Date:** 02-Feb-2025  
**Topics:**  
- Java Constructors: A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. It has the same name as the class and can be overloaded to allow different ways of initializing objects.  
- Instance vs. Class Variables: Instance variables are tied to a specific object and are created when the object is instantiated. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class, defined using the static keyword, and are created when the class is loaded.  
- Access Modifiers: Access modifiers in Java (e.g., public, private, protected) control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. They determine which other classes can access or modify a given member.  

## Day-10  
**Date:** 04-Feb-2025  
**Topics:**  
- `static` Keyword: The `static` keyword allows defining class-level members that belong to the class rather than instances, useful for shared variables and methods.  
- `final` Keyword: The `final` keyword is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and restrict class inheritance.  
- `instanceof` Operator: The `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass, useful for type checking and safe casting.  
- **Level 1 Lab Practice:** Practical exercises covering the above topics to reinforce understanding through hands-on implementation.
